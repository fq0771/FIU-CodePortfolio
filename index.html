                    A senior student finishing my Bachelors focused in Computer Science from Florida International University.
                     Have heavily worked with Java, Python, and C in both my coursework and in a wide array of workshops including 
                     Software Development, Game Development, and Unix Programming. Meanwhile, also became an experienced salesperson
